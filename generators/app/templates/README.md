# Web App
  
Because we all really just wanna get right down to building an app, with zero upfront bullshit tooling setup cost.


## Usage
Run the following:
```
    npm run build
```
    
This will transpile the source into the `dist/` directory and also copy over any relevant static files.  Then you can
just open the `index.html` file in that directory and see the app in action.

And that's it!  Look at `src/js/index.js` to modify/replace the javascript with your own.
